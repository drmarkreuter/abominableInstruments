# abominable Instruments

### A repo for my sample instruments, usually in both SFZ and decentSampler format

## Brassando
#### A sampled euphoium, trumpet, and combined euphonium + trumpet patch in SFZ and decentSampler format. The euphonium is gloriously wobbly in pitch (blame the operator...)

## Toy Piano
#### A lovely wooden toy piano, sampling each note, with extended mapping across the entire keyboard. Provided in SFZ and decentSampler formats.
