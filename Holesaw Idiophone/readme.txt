Holesaw Idiophone

Welcome to my sample instrument. 

The holesaw idiophone is a homemade instrument, 4 hole saws attached to a small wooden box with a contact microphone.

There are Sfz and DecentSampler instruments here, both in the instruments folder. Samples are in the sampled folder. If you alter the directoy structure, the instruments might not work.
